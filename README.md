This repo is about our Project **Resource allocation uisng deep reinforcement learning**. 
The main work  done was estimating QOE for video streaming(over HTTP) and  optimal resource allocation using **Deep reinforcement learning** techniques
The work is based on this [research paper](/QoE Evaluation for Video Streaming.pdf) and [survey paper](/survey-paper.pdf)
The project is done by Havish , Adarsh(Myself) and Manohar under Dr.Sumohana(Professor)
